# Brighmed

This is a style based on the cartography of Mapbox's OSM Bright, for use with [Meddo](https://github.com/kartotherian/meddo) vector tiles.

## Install

- Set up and install [Meddo](https://github.com/kartotherian/meddo)
- Edit project.yml to have the `source` be the location of the tm2source, e.g. `source: tmsource:///home/ubuntu/meddo`
- Install the Noto family of fonts (e.g. `sudo apt-get install fonts-noto*`)
- Open with Kosmtik or Mapbox Studio Classic. With Kosmtik this can be done with `kosmtik serve project.yml`
